### **General Instructions:**

Choose an algorithm from the dropdown visible at the top stating **Choose a cryptographic algorithm**. By default, the simulation page will open for symmetric-key cryptography.

### Follow these steps for symmetric-key cryptography:

1. First enter your message (any combination of characters) and secret key and press submit.  
2. Then, in step 2 of the algorithm, enter your secret key and press submit to view your message.

### Follow these steps for Asymmetric-key cryptography:

1. Click on the **Generate Keys** button to generate your random keys.  
2. Then enter the message (any combination of characters) you want to encrypt along with the public key in the Encryption Key field and click the **Encrypt Message** button.  
3. Then enter your private key in the Decryption Key field and click the **Decode Message** button to view the decrypted message identical to the original message.  
4. Also try entering a false private key and you will observe that the message is not decrypted successfully and is different from your original message.

### Follow these steps for RSA Algorithm:

1. Click the **Generate Prime Numbers** button to generate random primes.  
2. Enter the `N` and `PHI` values and click the **Submit** button.  
3. Then click the **Generate E** button to generate the appropriate value.  
4. Generate keys by clicking the **Generate Keys** button.  
5. Now enter the message (numeric in the range 0 - 520) you want to encrypt.  
6. Now click the encrypt/decrypt button to generate the encryption along with the decrypted message.  
7. You will observe that the original and decrypted message match, hence validating the algorithm.
